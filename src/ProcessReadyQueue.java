 * This class behaves as static - declared final to prevent extension of the class
 * Private constructor prevents instantiation by client code as we do not want to instantiate
 * Make all the members and functions of the class static - since the class cannot be instantiated
 * no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed.
 * The process ready queue is implemented in different way depending on the scheduler.
 * 1) If FCFS - use arrival time to sort queue
 * 2) If SRTF - use remaining time to sort queue
 * 3) If RR - starts off with arrival time but an early arriving process with a long burst time may end up at the back
 * of the line, so need a simple list to maintain order. A pre-empted process will go to the tail. After quantum
 * expires, next process is obtained from the head.
